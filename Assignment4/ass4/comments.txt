Assumptions:
Uses shorts for release years, and therefore assumes that this system won't
be used for movies released after the year 32,767 AD.

Ultimately, I ended up using the Second Pass of the factory pattern, parsing
the movie data mostly in static Mediea::create function in media.cpp

Still a little rusty on parsing strings, these are the resources I used on ass3
when figuring out how to best get the info needed from each file line:

I used cplusplus.com quite a bit for other stuff too. Here's a few of the pages
that I found useful.

For iterators: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/begin/

For some basic vector stuff:
