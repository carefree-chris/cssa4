Assumptions:

1. In order to meet the stock requirements for classics, I had to assume that
a movie with the same director, title, and release date count as the same
movie. I did not make this assumption with comedies or dramas.

2. I use shorts for release years, and therefore assume that this system won't
be used for movies released after the year 32,767 AD.

Ultimately, I ended up using the Second Pass of the factory pattern, parsing
the movie data mostly in static Mediea::create function in media.cpp

I reused some code from ass2. Credit to Yussuf Pisan for BinaryNode class

Still a little rusty on parsing strings, these are the resources I used on ass3
when figuring out how to best get the info needed from each file line:

I used cplusplus.com quite a bit for other stuff too. Here's a few of the pages
that I found useful.

For iterators: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/begin/
